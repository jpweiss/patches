Modifications &amp; Enhancements that I've Made to Other Software, in Handy Patch Form!


All code in this git repository is under the same license as the
software that it patches/modifies.


You will always find a single patch file that you'll need to apply
directly to the source code.  I haven't compressed these patches, for
your convenience; you can view the patch file via the GitHub web
interface.

Sometimes, you'll also find a subdirectory of additonal files, which
comprise parts of a new Debian source package containing the changes.
In those cases, the README will contain instructions for what to do.
